# canvas-game
My first try at a canvas game in Javascript.
## To-do list
- ~~Physics engine~~
- ~~Better character art~~
- ~~Random color terrain generation~~
- ~~Level system~~
- ~~Speed cap for character~~ (not going to do it, keeping it as it is)
- ~~Portals~~ and switches to make it puzzle-y
- ~~More~~ levels (Just added some!)
- ~~Weather for different levels~~ (~~rain~~, ~~night time~~, ~~etc.~~)
- Storyline?
- Creepy horror ambience
